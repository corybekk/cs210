The Ps command shows all the processes I am running and if I do ps aux it shows eveyones
processes.If you want to see how many processes are running for a specific program you can 
use the ps command and the program.
The loop program will run non stop; to bring the 
program to the forground you can put the fg command while its running
and it will keep it running even if you exit the program. 
To stop the program you can type in kill and the pid number. If that doesn't work you can use 
the command kill -9. You can put in the command ^z and it will suspend the program, but it 
wont kill it; the program will still show that it is active when the ps command is 
entered. The jobs command lists the jobs that you are running in the background and in
the foreground.
