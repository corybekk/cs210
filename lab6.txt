Say we have a file called literature containing the following text.
"Prepare to embrace your creators in the stygian haunts of hell,
barbarian", gasped the first soldier.
"Only after you have kissed the fleeting stead of death, wretch!"
returned Grignr.
.
A sweeping blade of flashing steel riveted from the massive barbarians
hide enameled shield as his rippling right arm thrust forth, sending a
steel shod blade to the hilt into the soldiers vital organs. The disemboweled 
mercenary crumpled from his saddle and sank to the clouded sward, 
sprinkling the parched dust with crimson droplets of escaping life
fluid.
