The Ps command shows all the processes I am running and if I do ps aux it shows eveyones
processes. you can run the program loop and it will run the program non stop; to bring the 
program to the forground you can put fg and it will keep it running even if you exit the program. 
To stop the program you can type in kill and the pid number. If that doesn't work you can use 
the command kill -9.
